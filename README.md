# JAVA-Pipe-Game-Board---Server-Side

A server Side Code for Pipes Board game.
can automatically solve Levels (n X m) and provide solution in short time (depends on the size of the board, mostly no longer then 2 seconds)
The main target of the game is to connect the "Source Tile" to "Goal Tile" by rotating the pipes on the board.
After solving the level, the solution will be save in local cache.

Solving Algorithms:
- BFS
- DFS
- Best First Search
- Hill Climbing

In the project I also developed a system that provide solutions for same-format games (implements Searchable<T> Interface)
